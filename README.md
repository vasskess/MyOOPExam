This is my Python Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) exam, which serves as the culmination of my OOP course at SoftUni wich encompasses
the application of OOP principles and concepts to solve a specific problem named "Horse Racings". The exam focuses on solving a specific problem that requires the application of OOP concepts.
It also includes unit tests for a code provided by SoftUni named bookstore.
